Would you like to dive deeper into any of these areas, or is there another feature you’d like to flesh out further? Let me know where you'd like to focus, and we can outline the technical or strategic details!

To help you start building the **AccessEase** project using **Node.js** and **React**, I'll guide you through the setup and core components based on the accessibility-focused features discussed earlier. Here's how you can build out the foundation, focusing on a **customizable accessibility overlay** for any website.

### **Project Setup**

#### 1. **Backend with Node.js and Express**

This will handle the user’s custom profiles and serve accessibility metadata to the frontend.

#### 2. **Frontend with React**

React will be used to manage the accessibility components (text-to-speech, high-contrast mode, simplified content) and interact with the Node.js backend for custom profiles.

---

### **Step-by-Step Development**

---

### 1. **Project Initialization**

#### Backend (Node.js)

-   Initialize a new Node.js project for the backend:

    ```bash
    mkdir access-ease-backend
    cd access-ease-backend
    npm init -y
    npm install express mongoose cors body-parser
    ```

-   Set up the basic Express server:

    ```js
    // access-ease-backend/server.js
    const express = require("express");
    const mongoose = require("mongoose");
    const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
    const cors = require("cors");

    const app = express();

    // Middleware
    app.use(bodyParser.json());
    app.use(cors());

    // Connect to MongoDB (Replace with your MongoDB URI)
    mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/accessEaseDB", {
        useNewUrlParser: true,
        useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });

    const port = process.env.PORT || 5000;
    app.listen(port, () => {
        console.log(`Server running on port ${port}`);
    });
    ```

#### Frontend (React)

-   Create the React project:
    ```bash
    npx create-react-app access-ease-frontend
    cd access-ease-frontend
    npm install axios react-router-dom
    ```

---

### 2. **Backend: Building the API (Node.js)**

#### a. **User Accessibility Profile Schema**

-   In MongoDB, store user accessibility profiles to allow customization:

    ```js
    // access-ease-backend/models/UserProfile.js
    const mongoose = require("mongoose");

    const UserProfileSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
        userId: String,
        preferences: {
            highContrast: { type: Boolean, default: false },
            textSize: { type: String, default: "medium" },
            textToSpeech: { type: Boolean, default: false },
            simplifiedContent: { type: Boolean, default: false },
        },
    });

    module.exports = mongoose.model("UserProfile", UserProfileSchema);
    ```

#### b. **API Routes**

-   Create an API to handle user profile management:

    ```js
    // access-ease-backend/routes/userProfile.js
    const express = require("express");
    const UserProfile = require("../models/UserProfile");
    const router = express.Router();

    // Get user profile
    router.get("/:userId", async (req, res) => {
        const profile = await UserProfile.findOne({
            userId: req.params.userId,
        });
        if (!profile) {
            return res.status(404).json({ message: "Profile not found" });
        }
        res.json(profile);
    });

    // Update user profile
    router.put("/:userId", async (req, res) => {
        const updatedProfile = await UserProfile.findOneAndUpdate(
            { userId: req.params.userId },
            { $set: { preferences: req.body.preferences } },
            { new: true }
        );
        res.json(updatedProfile);
    });

    module.exports = router;
    ```

-   Use the routes in the `server.js`:
    ```js
    // access-ease-backend/server.js
    const userProfileRoutes = require("./routes/userProfile");
    app.use("/api/profile", userProfileRoutes);
    ```

---

### 3. **Frontend: Building the Accessibility Overlay (React)**

#### a. **Creating User Preferences Context**

-   Manage user accessibility preferences globally using **React Context**:

    ```js
    // access-ease-frontend/src/context/AccessibilityContext.js
    import React, { createContext, useState, useEffect } from "react";
    import axios from "axios";

    const AccessibilityContext = createContext();

    const AccessibilityProvider = ({ children }) => {
        const [preferences, setPreferences] = useState({
            highContrast: false,
            textSize: "medium",
            textToSpeech: false,
            simplifiedContent: false,
        });

        useEffect(() => {
            // Fetch user preferences (assuming userId is available)
            axios.get("/api/profile/user123").then((response) => {
                setPreferences(response.data.preferences);
            });
        }, []);

        const updatePreferences = (newPreferences) => {
            setPreferences(newPreferences);
            // Update preferences in the backend
            axios.put("/api/profile/user123", { preferences: newPreferences });
        };

        return (
            <AccessibilityContext.Provider
                value={{ preferences, updatePreferences }}
            >
                {children}
            </AccessibilityContext.Provider>
        );
    };

    export { AccessibilityContext, AccessibilityProvider };
    ```

#### b. **Building Accessibility Components**

-   Create components to allow users to toggle accessibility features.

1. **High Contrast Mode**:

    ```js
    // access-ease-frontend/src/components/HighContrastToggle.js
    import React, { useContext } from "react";
    import { AccessibilityContext } from "../context/AccessibilityContext";

    const HighContrastToggle = () => {
        const { preferences, updatePreferences } =
            useContext(AccessibilityContext);

        const toggleContrast = () => {
            updatePreferences({
                ...preferences,
                highContrast: !preferences.highContrast,
            });
        };

        return (
            <button onClick={toggleContrast}>
                {preferences.highContrast
                    ? "Disable High Contrast"
                    : "Enable High Contrast"}
            </button>
        );
    };

    export default HighContrastToggle;
    ```

2. **Text Size Control**:

    ```js
    // access-ease-frontend/src/components/TextSizeControl.js
    import React, { useContext } from "react";
    import { AccessibilityContext } from "../context/AccessibilityContext";

    const TextSizeControl = () => {
        const { preferences, updatePreferences } =
            useContext(AccessibilityContext);

        const handleTextSizeChange = (event) => {
            updatePreferences({
                ...preferences,
                textSize: event.target.value,
            });
        };

        return (
            <select
                value={preferences.textSize}
                onChange={handleTextSizeChange}
            >
                <option value="small">Small</option>
                <option value="medium">Medium</option>
                <option value="large">Large</option>
            </select>
        );
    };

    export default TextSizeControl;
    ```

#### c. **App Component and Overlay Integration**

-   Render these components in your main **App.js** or as an overlay on the screen:

    ```js
    // access-ease-frontend/src/App.js
    import React from "react";
    import { AccessibilityProvider } from "./context/AccessibilityContext";
    import HighContrastToggle from "./components/HighContrastToggle";
    import TextSizeControl from "./components/TextSizeControl";

    function App() {
        return (
            <AccessibilityProvider>
                <div className="app">
                    <h1>Welcome to AccessEase</h1>
                    <HighContrastToggle />
                    <TextSizeControl />
                </div>
            </AccessibilityProvider>
        );
    }

    export default App;
    ```

-   In the **CSS file**, implement high-contrast mode and text size scaling:

    ```css
    .high-contrast {
        background-color: black;
        color: white;
    }

    body[data-text-size="small"] {
        font-size: 12px;
    }
    body[data-text-size="medium"] {
        font-size: 16px;
    }
    body[data-text-size="large"] {
        font-size: 20px;
    }
    ```
