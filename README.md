# Themes Development

Creating a WordPress theme involves creating a set of files and organizing them in a specific structure. Below is a basic example of a simple WordPress theme.

1. **Create a new folder for your theme:**

   -  Create a folder in the `wp-content/themes/` directory. You can name it anything you like; for example, "my_custom_theme."

2. **Create the main stylesheet file:**

   -  Inside your theme folder, create a file named `style.css`.
   -  Add the following content to `style.css`:

   ```css
   /*
   Theme Name: My Custom Theme
   Description: A simple custom WordPress theme
   Author: Your Name
   Version: 1.0
   */

   /* Add your CSS styles below this line */
   ```

   -  Replace "Your Name" with your actual name.

3. **Create the main template file:**

   -  Create a file named `index.php` in your theme folder.
   -  Add the basic structure of an HTML document and include the WordPress functions to display content:

   ```php
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html lang="en">
   ```

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Page title </title>
</head>

<body>

</body>

</html>
   ```
