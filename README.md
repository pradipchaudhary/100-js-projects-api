# Themes Development

Creating a WordPress theme involves creating a set of files and organizing them in a specific structure. Below is a basic example of a simple WordPress theme.

1. **Create a new folder for your theme:**

   -  Create a folder in the `wp-content/themes/` directory. You can name it anything you like; for example, "my_custom_theme."

2. **Create the main stylesheet file:**

   -  Inside your theme folder, create a file named `style.css`.
   -  Add the following content to `style.css`:

   ```css
   /*
   Theme Name: My Custom Theme
   Description: A simple custom WordPress theme
   Author: Your Name
   Version: 1.0
   */

   /* Add your CSS styles below this line */
   ```

   -  Replace "Your Name" with your actual name.

3. **Create the main template file:**

   -  Create a file named `index.php` in your theme folder.
   -  Add the basic structure of an HTML document and include the WordPress functions to display content:

   ```php
   <?php get_header(); ?>

   <div id="content">
       <?php if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post(); ?>
           <article <?php post_class(); ?>>
               <h2><a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>"><?php the_title(); ?></a></h2>
               <?php the_content(); ?>
           </article>
       <?php endwhile; endif; ?>
   </div>

   <?php get_sidebar(); ?>

   <?php get_footer(); ?>
   ```

4. **Create header and footer files:**

   -  Create a file named `header.php` and a file named `footer.php`.
   -  Add the basic structure for header and footer:

   ```php
   <!-- header.php -->
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html <?php language_attributes(); ?>>
   <head>
       <meta charset="<?php bloginfo('charset'); ?>">
       <title><?php bloginfo('name'); ?> - <?php bloginfo('description'); ?></title>
       <?php wp_head(); ?>
   </head>
   <body <?php body_class(); ?>>

   <!-- footer.php -->
   <?php wp_footer(); ?>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

5. **Activate your theme:**
   -  Log in to your WordPress admin dashboard.
   -  Go to "Appearance" -> "Themes."
   -  You should see your theme listed; click "Activate."

Your basic WordPress theme is now set up. Customize the `index.php`, `header.php`, and `footer.php` files according to your design and add more template files as needed. You can also add CSS and JavaScript files to enhance the styling and functionality of your theme.
